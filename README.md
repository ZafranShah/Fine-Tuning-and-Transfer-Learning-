# Fine-Tuning-and-Transfer-Learning-

Let us talk first about the difference between the Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning:

In transfer learning we only train and optimize the weights of the newly added classification layers while we freeze the weights 
of the original model. Whereas, in fine tuning we train and optimize the weights of new classification layers as well as some or 
all layers from the model.
